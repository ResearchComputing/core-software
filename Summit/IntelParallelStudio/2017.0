You have to delete the intel directory in /home/rcops or it won't let you
install (only lets you upgrade previous install...)

Choose license manager activation and then offline activation. Point it to
a license file.

You can't build the vtune sampling drivers as a non-root user. Install
without them and build them as root later.
