II.2.1. C Binding

To use the Intel(R) MPI Library C binding with the PGI* compiler,
do the following steps:

1. Make sure that the PGI* C compiler (pgcc) is in your PATH.

2. Go to the directory c

3. Run the command

   # make MPI_INST=<MPI_path> CC=<C_compiler> NAME=<name> \
     [ARCH=<arch>]

   with

   <MPI_path>        - installation directory of the Intel(R) MPI Library
   <C_compiler>      - compiler to be used
   <name>            - base name for the compiler script
   <arch>            - set `intel64` or `mic` architecture, `intel64` is used by
                       default

4. Copy the resulting <arch> directory to the Intel(R) MPI Library installation
   directory.


II.2.2. C++ Binding

To create the Intel(R) MPI Library C++ binding library using the
PGI* C++ compiler, do the following steps:

1. Make sure that the PGI* C++ compiler (pgCC) is in your PATH.

2. Go to the directory cxx

3. Run the command

   # make MPI_INST=<MPI_path> CXX=<C++_compiler> NAME=<name> \
     [ARCH=<arch>] [MIC=<mic option>]

   with

   <MPI_path>        - installation directory of the Intel(R) MPI Library
   <C++_compiler>    - compiler to be used
   <name>            - base name for the libraries and compiler script
   <arch>            - set `intel64` or `mic` architecture, `intel64` is used by
                       default
   <mic option>      - compiler option to generate code for Intel(R) MIC
                       Architecture. Availalbe only when ARCH=mic is set, `-mmic`
                       is used by default in such case

4. Copy the resulting <arch> directory to the Intel(R) MPI Library installation
   directory.


II.2.3. Fortran 77 Binding

To use the Intel(R) MPI Library Fortran 77 binding with the PGI*
compiler, do the following steps:

1. Make sure that the PGI* Fortran 77 compiler (pgf77) is in your PATH.

2. Go to the directory f77

3. Run the command

   # make MPI_INST=<MPI_path> F77=<f77_compiler> NAME=<name> \
     [ARCH=<arch>]

   with

   <MPI_path>        - installation directory of the Intel(R) MPI Library
   <f77_compiler>    - compiler to be used
   <name>            - base name for the compiler script
   <arch>            - set `intel64` or `mic` architecture, `intel64` is used by
                       default

4. Copy the resulting <arch> directory to the Intel(R) MPI Library installation
   directory.


II.2.4. Fortran 90 Binding

To create the Intel(R) MPI Library Fortran 95 binding library using
the PGI* Fortran 90 compiler, do the following steps:

1. Make sure that the PGI* Fortran 90 compiler (pgf90) is in your PATH

2. Go to the directory f90

3. Run the command

   # make MPI_INST=<MPI_path> F90=<f90_compiler> NAME=<name> \
     [ILP64=<ILP64 options>] [ARCH=<arch>] [MIC=<mic option>]

   with

   <MPI_path>        - installation directory of the Intel(R) MPI Library
   <f90_compiler>    - compiler to be used
   <name>            - base name for the libraries and compiler script
   <ILP64 options>   - compiler option to specify 64 bits size for integer  and
                       logical variables
   <arch>            - set `intel64` or `mic` architecture, `intel64` is used by
                       default
   <mic option>      - compiler option to generate code for Intel(R) MIC
                       Architecture. Availalbe only when ARCH=mic is set, `-mmic`
                       is used by default in such case

4. Copy the resulting <arch> directory to the Intel(R) MPI Library installation
   directory.

   NOTE: Don't remove existing libraries libmpifort.a, libmpifort.so.
