QT 5.9.1 had no config.log. Was installed with system compiler and no modules loaded:
./configure --prefix=/curc/sw/qt/5.9.1
make
make install


Note: You can list features that don't show up in ./configure --help with
./configure -list-features


./configure --prefix=/curc/sw/qt/5.9.1 -feature-webrtc
