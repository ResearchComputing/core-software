The Research Computing core software environment provides compilers,
mpi, libraries, language environments, and applications that are of
general use to the CU Boulder Research Computing user community.

## Manual installation procedures

Manual software installation procedures are available in the `Summit`
and `Blanca` directories, organized by
`Cluster/SoftwareName/VersionNumber`. The `VersionNumber` file
contains build notes (bash commands, notes, instructions etc.) to
install that software package for each compiler and MPI.

## Spack

Spack, when deployed as intended, will be a central part of the
provisioning of our Core Software service. Included here is the
configuration and installation script for Spack as installed and
presented at CU Boulder Research Computing.
